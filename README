Install details:
You can source Reco directly from .vimrc as you can see in video 
Or use any plugin manager i.e pathogen 
Only setting you probably would like to change is backup_dir 
Set in .vimrc 
py reco.backup_dir=<your new dir> #default is your home folder 
or you  can change path in reco.vim
