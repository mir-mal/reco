1. Description                              *reco*
Reco automates Vim recovery from swap file process. First copy of your swap
and file is made, then Reco answers |SwapExists| questions for you so you don't need
to bother anymore. And at the end it is deleting old swap files.
Very useful when Vim crashes and you have to recover whole session and waiste
your time to answer Swap questions for each file and then manually delete each
swap. Also Reco has |DiffSwap| function so you can check in new tab difference
before and after recovery. Reco also keeps original files and swap in |reco_dir|
until you close Vim.

2. Requirements                             *reco-requirements* *reco_dir*
You can set directory where Reco will store temporary data by setting:
python reco.backup_dir = <your dir> or directly in reco.vim
Default direcotry is your home folder. Data are store ther only until you close
Vim, so there is no extra garbage in home folder because of Reco.

Reco filename format is file full_path where "/" are replaced by "%" i.e:
/etc/hosts = %etc%hosts

IMPORTANT:
DO NOT APPEND "/" to end of path, as reco does it for you

3. Recovery                                 *reco-recovery*
Reco is called each time Vim call auto-command |SwapExists|. Then:
 -  Reco first copies 'swapfile' and file to recover into |reco_dir|
 -  Setting |v:swapchoice| to delete swap as answer, so you want see Swap
    detect window
 -  Then using copy of swap from |reco_dir| is recovering swap file
 -  At the end it is setting |VimLeavePre| auto-command to clear |reco_dir|

4. DiffSwap                 *reco-diffswap* *DiffSwap* *diff_swap* *reco.diff_swap*
Reco keeps before recovery copy of your file so if you like to check difference Reco have
|DiffSwap| function just call it from Ex mode: py reco.diff_swap() and Reco will open new tab
with both versions before and after recovery of your file
|DiffSwap| file works till you close your Vim instance as then Reco is clearing
|reco_dir|.

REMEMBER: |DiffSwap| only works if there is before recovery file in |reco_dir|

5. |Before_recovery|                  *reco.before* *reco.before_recovery*
You can alwyes read file before recovery using Ex mode: py |reco.before_recovery|()
Later if you change your mind you can alwyes undo read and you have file after
recovery

6. Tips, useful settings
Few words about Vim recovery and version control settings. Recovery process and
'swapfile' cover data from last write. Swap file update is control via:
'updatetime' and 'updatecount' and swap is only updated if you made any 
changes to buffer.
I strongly advice to set 'updatetime' to 1000(1s) as then you always have all
unsaved data in swap file. And because swap is only updated when you made 
changes, low 'updatetime' is not a big overhead
