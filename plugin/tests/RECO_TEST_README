When testing plugin alwyes use clean instance (no vimrc, noplugins)
There is 2 test runners:

test_runner_for_test_reco.py -> testing all Reco methods
test_runner_for_test_reco_au.py -> testing Reco API in auto-commands
They are sepereated and must be tested in seperate vim instance as 
auto-commands could have impact on buffers and break methods 

Default directory for backups and swaps is './test_files' so its important
to run test_cases from test directory or modified test_cases to match
your preference

While in test directory run those commands to preform tests:
vim  -u NONE -N --noplugin -c 'pyfile test_runner_for_test_reco.py'
vim  -u NONE -N --noplugin -c 'pyfile test_runner_for_test_reco_au.py'
